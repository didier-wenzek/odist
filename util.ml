let id x = x

let split f g = fun x -> (f x, g x)

(* Function that lets you return early from a computation.
   Adapted from Alan Frish's version of https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/91,
   with the constraint that the return function is only used
   in contexts having the same type as the whole expression.

     with_return (fun return ->
       List.fold_left (fun acc x -> if x >= 0 then acc + x else return acc)
                      0
                      list
     )

let with_return (type t) f =
  let module M = struct exception Return of t end in
  try f (fun x -> raise (M.Return x)) with M.Return x -> x
